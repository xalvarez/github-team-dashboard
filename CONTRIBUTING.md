# How to contribute to GitHub Team Dashboard

First of all, thanks for wanting to contribute to **GitHub Team Dashboard**! Help is
welcome and having more contributors will make this project bigger and better faster.

## Issues

If you want to contribute to the project, please have a look at the
[issues section](https://github.com/xalvarez/github-team-dashboard/issues). There
you can either create a bug report or discuss about a potential new feature.

Whatever the case may be, it's a good idea to first have a look at the other issues,
just in case your bug or idea has already been discussed in a different issue.

### About feature requests

Before starting to work on a new feature you should create a new issue. Otherwise you
may come across the situation that the feature you spent time working on isn't
desired by the maintainer or someone else has already been working on it in parallel.

Should you want to work on a feature please mention it in the related issue. The issue
wil be assigned to you, so that other contributors can see there's already someone
working on that particular feature.

## Code Style

In general you should have a look at how existing code looks like and adapt to the
style you see.

### Kotlin

This project follows
[Kotlin's official coding convention](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html)
as enforced in [gradle.properties](gradle.properties)
